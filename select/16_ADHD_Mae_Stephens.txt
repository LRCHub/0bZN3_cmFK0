I don't remember what I said two minutes ago
Have alarms every minute on my goddamn phone
Spent my entire day, lazy, just sat at home
Bingin' shows I've seen fifty times before, like
What the fuck was I singin' about?
Got a hundred different riddles I can't figure out
Buy the same damn snacks so I don't run out
Got a new funny joke, lemme tell you about it, like
New hyper-fixation, God, I'm over-stimulated
And my mind just keeps replayin' over and over
ADHD, what the fuck are you doin' to me?
And my ADHD, God, you put my mind at ease
I got the OCD and the trauma, please
But my ADHD is what keeps the love for you and me
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
ADHD
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
ADHD
A is for attention that I try to take the lead
And the D is for the deficit of functionality
Then the H is hyperactive, which is absolutely me
And disorder is the wrong term, it's just my normality, ha
ADHD, what the fuck are you doin' to me?
And my ADHD, God, you put my mind at ease
I got the OCD and the trauma, please
But my ADHD is what keeps the love for you and me
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
ADHD
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
ADHD and me
What the fuck was I singin' about?
What the fuck was I singin' about?

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
ADHD
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da

ADHD and me
Nah-nah, hey, hey, ah
Nah-nah, hey, hey, no
Nah-nah, hey, hey, it's just my normality, ha
Nah-nah, hey, nah, nah
Nah-nah, hey, nah, nah
Oh-nah, hey, hey, it's just my normality, ha
