I can't seem to focus on anything I love anymore.
Don't know why you need to know this why do you even come and see my tours supposed to do the dishes supposed to take my girlfriend out to eat I just wanna write a hit song, so add another hour cuz I ain't got time to sleep.
Another of these huslin' demons and I'm alright.
Another of these huslin' dreams cuz I dont sleep at night.
Oh we felt all the pressure comin in from all sides.
Another of these huslin' demons and I'm alright, alright.
Cant read that godd damn book, no.
I stare at the pages and I left my ID 3 thousand miles away shit.
And the liquor they don't help, no.
I slayed a thousand stages, and I forgot my lyrics today Another of these huslin' demons and I'm alright alright.
Another of these huslin' dreams cuz I don"t sleep at night.
Cuz we both felt the pressure comin in from all sides, all sides.
I can't seem to focus, supposed to do the dishes.
Another of these huslin' demons and I'm alright alright.
Another of these huslin' dreams cuz I don't sleep at night.
Cuz we both felt the pressure comin in from all sides, all sides.
Another of this huslin danger and I'm alright.
