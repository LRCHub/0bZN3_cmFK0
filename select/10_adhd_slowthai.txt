The last one
Sick as pig, can you help?
Tryna get a grip, fingers slip, then I melt
Sitting in a pit, only me and myself
I can't deal with the screams only screaming at myself (ah)
Tryna protect, so I project
Deflect and they call it self-defense
Feel the pressure and we all got our reasons
Smile on the out, but inside I keep bleeding
Fun and games 'til you gotta take the blame
And I said it was me 'cause I'll do it for my mates
Then again, would they say the same?
And it's all tongue and cheek tryna sweep out the fakes
Love never felt real, the wheels won't brake
They can't see the tears, through the rain drops
Tough lad and I always put a face on
Told me already that leopards can't change spots
Sad songs, a sickness
The passenger, always been a witness
Excalibur, incision
Goodbye is my only decision
Sad songs, a sickness
The passenger, always been a witness
Excalibur, incision
Goodbye is my only decision
Overthink, sink in my seat
Eat, sleep, repeat, what you know about T?
Smoke weed, only way I fall asleep
Same routine, drink 'til I can't speak
Slave to the progress, I obsess
'Cause I ain't got control yet
I'm tryna fly but my wings feel broken
An eagle encaged in a closure
Lowest of lows, decomposing, I'm sober (loner)
I can't be alone, why I always pick the phone up
I beg you pick the phone up
(Beg you pick the phone up)
Sad songs, a sickness
The passenger, always been a witness (I hope they pick up the phone)
Excalibur, incision
Goodbye is my only decis-
(What's goin' on?)
Yo
(Yo, what's happening?)
Nothing, I just wanted to say, bruv, I love you, man
And I hope you're doing well
And I miss you every day you're not around
Feed my deficit, life I'm yet to live
Ain't no SNM, I just shake my head
You can't be my friend, living and I'm dead
Caught in Charlotte's Web, I can't feel myself
Mind complexity be the death of me
Heavy weaponry at my melon, squeezed
I got tendencies, psycho tendencies
Touch me tenderly, Heaven let me in
I think you got amnesia ('nesia)
And this stress soon to give me alopecia ('pecia)
And I'm vexed tryna smile like Mona Lisa (smile)
Feel to exit like I ain't got a visa
